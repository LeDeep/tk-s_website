Website for a family friend. Website will be a place where family members, spread out in the United States, Thailand, England, Australia, and China, can connect. The website will have authentication for users, and ability for users to post blog updates and write to a message board.

Built with Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, Twitter-Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, and jQuery.

Built authentication from scratch instead of using Devise, like I have on most other projects. Main reason for this is to get a clearer picture of how authentication works behind the scenes.

Decided to use Gravatar for profile images, since it doesn't require any uploading or storage. Site will include link to shared Shutterfly account. Will probably add a few images to home and about pages.
